## 🧼 Scene 1: The Soap Bubble Lab

Ravi slips on the floor and crashes into Professor TestTube's lab.

**Bubble the Soap Genie** appears in a foamy poof:

> "Welcome to my bubble kingdom! Did you know I'm made using **caustic soda (NaOH)**? It's the heart of soap-making!"

**Professor TestTube adds:**

> "And don’t forget, washing soda — that’s **Na₂CO₃·10H₂O** — helps clean your clothes!"

✅ **Q16: Used in preparation of soap?** → *NaOH*
✅ **Q21: Washing soda formula?** → *Na₂CO₃·10H₂O*

---

## 🍋 Scene 2: Acid Attack with Limo Sir

Ravi tastes lemon juice and screams, "So sour it burns!"

**Limo Sir:**

> "Ah, that’s **citric acid**, nature’s own sour bomb. Found in lemon, tamarind, and oranges too."

**Professor adds:**

> "Now contrast that with stomach acid — **HCl**, and in batteries, we use **H₂SO₄ – sulfuric acid**. Acids are everywhere!"

✅ **Q17: Acid in lemon?** → *Citric Acid*
✅ **Q29: Acid in car batteries?** → *Sulfuric Acid (H₂SO₄)*

---

## 🛢️ Scene 3: Captain Kerosene’s Metal Vault

Ravi sees a shiny metal explode in water and panics 😱

**Captain Kerosene lands dramatically:**

> "Don’t touch that! It's **sodium**, a reactive metal stored safely in **kerosene oil**. Same for potassium!"

He throws a thermos to Ravi, saying:

> "This metal would rather live in oil than take a bath in water!"

✅ **Q18: Metal stored in kerosene?** → *Sodium*
✅ (Related Concept): *Highly reactive alkali metals like potassium and lithium are also stored in kerosene.*

---

## 🧪 Scene 4: Explosive Chemistry with Professor TestTube

Professor takes **zinc** and adds dilute **HCl**. *Puff!* Hydrogen gas bubbles out! 🎈

**Ravi:** “Are we making balloon gas?”

**Professor TestTube:**

> "Technically yes, but don't inhale it! This is **Hydrogen gas**, formed when acids meet metals."

**Ravi:** “What’s that smell in the battery room?”

**Professor:** “That’s the same sulfuric acid at work!”

✅ **Q19: Gas from HCl + Zinc?** → *Hydrogen*
✅ **Q29: Acid in batteries?** (reinforced) → *H₂SO₄*

---

## 🥂 Scene 5: DJ Fermento’s Sugar Rave

Ravi enters a disco where sugar cubes are dancing 💃🕺

**DJ Fermento:**

> "Yo! Sugar + yeast = **Alcohol**! We call it **fermentation** — the oldest party trick in the world."

**Professor adds:**

> "Microbes breaking sugar into ethanol and CO₂. Cheers!"

✅ **Q20: Sugar to alcohol process?** → *Fermentation*
✅ (Related): Used in **alcoholic drinks, fuel, and bread-making.**

---

## 🚰 Scene 6: Water Woes and Solutions

The gang reaches a village with dirty water. Ravi asks how to purify it.

**Professor TestTube:**

> "Use **bleaching powder (CaOCl₂)** or **chlorine** to disinfect it. Both are water purifiers."

**CO2 Baba arrives** and says:

> "Speaking of water, blow into lime water and see the magic... Cloudy milky water — that’s my signature style!"

✅ **Q22: Used in water purification?** → *Bleaching Powder (CaOCl₂)*
✅ **Q23: Gas that turns lime water milky?** → *Carbon Dioxide (CO₂)*

---

## ☁️ Scene 7: Greenhouse Trouble

**Dadi 5000** projects an image of Earth heating up 🌍🔥

> “Beta, **CO₂** is not just milky gas — it’s also a **greenhouse gas** that traps heat!”

**Ravi:** “That's why we study climate change in GS too, right?”

✅ **Q24: A greenhouse gas?** → *Carbon Dioxide (CO₂)*
✅ (Related): *Also includes Methane (CH₄), Nitrous Oxide (N₂O), Ozone (O₃)*

---

## 🌡️ Scene 8: Liquid Metal Magic

They reach a thermometer shop.

**Ravi:** “What’s inside that tiny tube?”

**Professor TestTube:**

> “That’s **Mercury** — the only metal that’s liquid at room temperature. Toxic but handy in thermometers!”

✅ **Q25: Liquid metal at room temperature?** → *Mercury (Hg)*
✅ (Note): *Now being replaced by alcohol due to safety concerns.*

---

## 🎨 Scene 9: Pigment Detectives

Professor places a green leaf on paper, adds alcohol and waits...

Colors start to separate! 🌈

> "This technique is **chromatography** — useful to separate mixtures like inks and plant pigments."

✅ **Q26: Process to separate pigments?** → *Chromatography*
✅ (Real-life use): *Detecting drugs, testing food dyes, and forensics.*

---

## 🧂 Scene 10: Glass & Gas Finale

In a glass factory, **Soda Singh** is making bowls.

> “We use **sodium carbonate** to lower melting point of silica. Without it, no glass!”

Ravi asks about the light bulbs glowing nearby.

**Professor:**

> “That’s **Argon**, the chill noble gas that prevents filament burnout.”

✅ **Q27: Salt used in glass making?** → *Sodium Carbonate (Na₂CO₃)*
✅ **Q28: Gas in electric bulb?** → *Argon*

---

## 🧲 Scene 11: Rust in Peace

Ravi’s cycle is rusting in the rain ☔

**Dadi 5000:**

> “Rust = **oxidation** of iron in presence of air and moisture. It’s chemistry’s slow corrosion attack.”

✅ **Q30: Rusting is a process of?** → *Oxidation*
✅ (Note): *Prevented using painting, galvanizing, oiling.*
